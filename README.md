# Haunted Pet To-Do

A spooky, gamified to-do list for the Kiroween 2026 Costume Contest: finish your tasks and a little ghost pet thrives; ignore them and zombies crawl in. This repository is the public, MIT-licensed entry.

## Stack

Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript in strict mode, Tailwind CSS 4, pnpm, ESLint, Vitest, and fast-check. Game logic, Supabase, the LLM, and web push are not in this skeleton yet.

## Run

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm test
```

`pnpm dev` serves the landing page at <http://localhost:3000>. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm build` are available too. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` when you need local secrets; none are required to boot the landing page.

## Kiro

`/.kiro` holds the Kiro specs, steering docs, and hooks for this project. It is committed on purpose and is part of the hackathon submission.
